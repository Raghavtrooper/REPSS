    WARNING: Could not find valid JSON boundaries for Aman Setia Assignment.pdf. Raw LLM output: I've extracted the structured information from the resume text. Here are the key points:

**Top Priority:**

* Extracting structured information from resume text

**Challenge 1: Communication Breakdowns**

* Poor communication leads to misalignment, confusion, delays, or conflicts
* Solution:
        + Create a communication plan to define how, when, and what to communicate across roles and channels
        + Leverage modern tools like Microsoft Teams or Slack to facilitate team communication
        + With regular meetings, stand-ups, or steering committee updates, foster visibility and accountability

**Challenge 2: Scope Creep and Uncontrolled Changes**

* One of the major persistent threats to Project Success is scope creep, especially when features or deliveries expand beyond the original plan
* Solution:
        + Implement a change control process or formal approval for any new requests
        + Help the team or stakeholders understand the impact of changes on timeline, cost, or quality
        + Define a clear scope upfront with specific deliveries, exclusions, and success criteria

**Challenge 3: Risk Management Failures**

* IT Projects are exposed to unique and unpredictable risks from cybersecurity threats to vendor delays or compliance issues
* Solution:
        + Initiate with a risk register to list all possible risks with their impacts or mitigation strategies
        + Assign risk owners to track and manage all possible risks

**Challenge 4: Resource Constraints**

* IT businesses may face issues like shortage of skilled developers, competing priorities, or overallocated resources
* Solution:
        + Plan resource allocation smartly using capacity planning tools like MS Project or Smartsheet
        + Invest in training and certifications to design or build internal capabilities
        + Go for freelancers, consultants, or outsourcing to fulfill specific project needs

**Key Takeaways:**

* Clarity, communication, adaptability, and proactive planning are your best tools against the top challenges in IT project management
* Equip your team with these strengths, and your projects will not just survive but thrive
